## Description

This repo contains all codes used throughout my master's thesis on bagged regression trees.
These codes build plots for the theory section, perform Monte Carlo simulations, and 
compute and evaluate a real data forecast of S&P 500 volatility.
Codes can be run at the bottom of the scripts.
Some tables created by this code were not used in the final version of the thesis or modified manually.


## Credits 

This project was created with the [econ-project-templates](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/econ-project-templates).

The bagged tree model was built based on scikit-learn's BaggingRegressor and DecisionTreeRegressor.

Functions computing realized quantities from intraday stock data are based on the 
RealizedQuantities repo by Sebastian Bayer (https://github.com/BayerSe/RealizedQuantities).

The Diebold-Mariano test function is taken from John Tsang (https://github.com/johntwk/Diebold-Mariano-Test).
